** IMPORTANT **
- Code needs to be cleaned up, work in progress.
- Some problems will occur while reading the associated DICOM data on TCIA
  (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Head-Neck-PET-CT), 
  since some DICOM information has been modified by TCIA during the transfer.
  Adapting the code to solve these problems is a work in progress.
- Final testing of this code is thus a work in progress. Please let me know
  if you would like to work on the problems stated above: mart.vallieres@gmail.com
